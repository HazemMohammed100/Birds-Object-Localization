# Birds Object Localization
The Bird Object Localization Model is a computer vision project aimed at improving the detection and localization of birds in images. Birds are an integral part of our ecosystem, and their study and conservation require accurate identification and localization. Traditional methods of bird detection often rely on manual observation or limited datasets, making them time-consuming and less efficient. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques.

The Bird Object Localization Model utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. It uses MobileNetV2 with the initial weights of the imagenet dataset. The model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset to automatically identify and locate birds within digital images. The model's architecture combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with advanced localization techniques, enabling it to precisely outline the boundaries of birds in images.
